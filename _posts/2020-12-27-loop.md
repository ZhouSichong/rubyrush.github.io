title: The Power Of Computer Loop
---

I see two gaps get bigger over time: The gap between the rich and poor people, and the gap between the tech-savvy people and tech-illiterate people. These gaps cause most social issues today. As a computer programmer for all my career, I feel obligated to help tech-illiterate people to understand tech, so that I can help with fixing the second gap. IMO, fixing the second may help with fixing the first. In the year of 2020, who made most of the money, the anwser is peopel from tech backgroud, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Bitcoin fanboys and girls. On the other hand, Who lost most money? People who are tech-illiterate, Warren Buffet and many wall street funds. So helping people to understand tech is big deal, but how? IMO, The easist way for laymen to understand the power of tech is to understand the power of computer loop.

## Hard Loops vs Soft Loops
People say, only two inventions that matters in human history, one is wheel, they other is Computer/Internet. I will say, they are the same thing, cause they are both about looping, in other words, repeat the same process over and over again. But the process can be coded in a 'hard' or 'soft' manner, that's why we have hard loops and soft loops.

We having been enjoying what I call the 'hard loop' since the begin of history. Huamans kowns how to use wheel since maybe 10000 years ago. Wheels are a loop for one simple tasks, namely moving forward. About 300 years ago a guy named James Watt populized steam engine. With the power of fossil fuels, people wrap more complex tasks into a loop, people code their expertise in steel parts, than we came into the era of machines. Before computer era, human wisdom was coded with hard tangiable materials, usually steel, that's why I call loops 'hard loop', code expertise in hardware, and repeating with the power from fossile fuels or later electricity. When time comes to around 100 yeas ago, human beings were so optimistic, because of the industrial revlotion which brought by hard loop, has the real potential of getting rid of poerty and bring internal happiness for human being, once for all. But fact was, it did not, instead happiness, we trapping in to world wars. Obviously hard loops are not powerful or smart enough. We need something more.

That's where software came in. In early 19th century, People found materials we call semiconductor, has The ablity to hold electic state. later people invented simple electic components like transistors to hold two of these states 0s(power on) and 1s(power off), suprisingly, people find it possible to express all sorts of inpomantion with just 0 and 1. A new revoltuion came, 'soft loop' became possible. peopel start to use machines to process information, we call those machines computers. What is a 'soft loop'? Learning how to do looping is probably in every computer 101 course. Depending on which programming language you use, you may use keywords like 'while' or 'for' to do it. To give my definition, 'soft loop' is loop done by software, exactly like hard loop, it's nothing but looping on human expertise, but this time, the expertise is coded in software code rather than steel.

here, I want to foucus on bigger picture, on the great potential the soft loop and soft+hard loop, or automation, has to change the world.

## What is High Tech?
IMO, high tech is soft loop.

High tech used to be atomic power, robots, spaceshuttles, biotech and more, but Let's be honest for the past 40 years, humans have not made big progress on the other things expect software. If you talk about high tech in real industiess, it's amost nothing but software that people have in mind.

In realtiy, High Tech is so much not about scitific break throughs, it's about standarliztion. Technology, or we call it human productivity, moves forward like this, first we understand a problem, then we form expertise sovling the problem, the best proctise will be widespread, and become the knowledge free for everybody to use, which is called industrial standards. But before computers, people didn't find standarlization very attractive. Because the world is a big place, people think differently, a one fits all process to solve sth does not work so well. But when computer came, NO.1 All computers thinks only in 1/0, they are the same. NO.2 They repeat things tirelessly day and night. So it is now makes more sense to standerdize everything, and get the same best practise run all over the world. Take Amazon for example, it is not doing something new, but to do commerce more efficiently. But they are a high tech company, because they always use software to loop on the best practises of everything. Meituan is similar, food delivery is not anything new, but with the help of software code, best practises are documented and repeated. That also explains why high tech companies are always innovating fast, because what they do every day is looking to imporving the best ways to solve a problem, code them and loop on them. So In this sense What defines a high tech company is whether you consider software is the soul of your bussiness, rather than a component of your product. E.g Tesla is a high tech company. Toyota is not.

AI is not part of my soft loop. If everything we wrap into a soft loop is hard coded logic, what software can do is quite limited. For example, for more than 100 years, Machines can build car parts, but not cars. Elon Musk has a vision to build a machine to build machines, but that still a work in progress. Some tasks are just too complex to be preceisely depicted in clear step by step process. AI and Machine learning could make computers inteligence to a whole new level. Decisions will be made not based on hard coded logic, but rather on find best possible path to do a job by digging in big data. It's rediculuos to say AI is not part of high tech. But as far as I am concerned, AI is not part of Soft Loop I want to talk about in this piece, Cause in my soft loop, it's all about hard-coded logic, fixed processes.

To me, high Tech is about doucumented best practise in code, and repeat the code. 

## It's just get started
Perhaps the most important part of this piece is try to convince you everything soft loop can do is just getting started. Even in the year of 2020.

AI aside, Just the computer loops have not even reach it's one percent potential. There are still 99.99 of the daily tasks are not standarlized, not to mention looped by computers. People do want customized from time to time, but mostly people just want the best producted with best price. That's where standardlization shines. 

Tech favors big. The bigger a company gets, the more products it will make to follow the best process. And thus they will be more willing to invest in finding the best the process of building something. In high tech world, I won't encourage competition.  More resource should just flow to the best player in this area. For example, since nowadays Tesla is rich. They can invest more on the process, machine build a machine meaning you want to do your own robots, Tesla is able to buy a new robotic company, it is not something that a small company can afford. The world does not need a second and slightly inefficient Amazon, nobody will use the second best search engine. I believe it's logical to see only one company in more and more inducstirals in the future. If we ever need a second company to coexists in one area, that's is for other reasons, say, political balancing or backup. 

Automation will extend to socitey managment. Turned out, human wisdom is not just for building things, but also building a better society. The rise of Blockchain and Smart contract demonstrates the willingness of many people want to run our society based on best pratices and clear transprant rules. If you understand the power and flexibility of computer loops. You won't consider blockchain a joke.

Everything is just get started, big tech companies has the potentical to get bigger, new wild ideas may come true. People don't understand high tech juse see bubble, others see the beer.

## Conclution

I hope this piece will get you inspired, and get passionate about the possiblity of computer code. So you at leat understand why people are so passionate about compnies like Tesla, and Blockchain projects like Bitcion. I am hoping to get you passionate, and jump start to learn coding, invest in big tech giants or open standards, and help build more efficent industries, and a more fair society run buy human wisedom wrapped by loops.
