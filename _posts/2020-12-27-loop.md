title: The Power Of Computer Loop
---

I see two gaps get bigger over time: The gap between the rich and poor people, and the gap between the tech-savvy people and tech-illiterate people. These gaps cause most social issues today. As a computer programmer for all my career, I feel obligated to help tech-illiterate people to understand tech, so that I can help with fixing the second gap. IMO, fixing the second may help with fixing the first. In the year of 2020, who made most of the money, the anwser is people who knows tech deeply, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Bitcoin fanboys and girls. On the other hand, Who lost most money? People who are tech-illiterate, Warren Buffet and many wall street funds. So helping people to understand tech is big deal, but how? IMO, The easist way for laymen to understand the power of tech is to understand the power of computer loop. 

## Hard Loops vs Soft Loops
People say, only two inventions that matter in human history, one is wheel, they other is Computer/Internet. I will say, they are the same thing, cause they are both about looping, in other words, repeating the same process over and over again. But the process can be encoded in a 'hard' or 'soft' manner, that's why we have hard loops and soft loops.

People have been using what I call the 'hard loop' since maybe the beginning of our history. Huamans kowns how to use wheel since maybe 10000 years ago. Wheels do loops for one simple tasks, moving forward. About 300 years ago a guy named James Watt populized steam engines. With the power of fossil fuels, people started to wrap more complex tasks into loops, they encoded their expertise in steel parts, which took us to the era of machinery. Before computer era, human wisdom was coded with hard tangiable materials, usually steel, that's why I call that loops 'hard loop'. When time came to around 100 yeas ago, human beings were so optimistic, because of the industrial revlotion brought by hard loop, had the potential of sovling poverty once for all. But fact was, it did not. Instead happiness, we were trapped in two world wars. Obviously hard loops are not powerful or smart enough, not all expertise can be coded with steel, lots of work sill needed to be done by hand. We need something smarter.

That's where computer and software came in. In early 19th century, People found a new material called semiconductor, which can be used for produce electronic components to hold two states 0(power on) and 1(power off). Suprisingly, people found it possible to describle any information with just 0 and 1. A new revoltuion came. Peopel start to use machines to process information, we call those machines computers. So what is a 'soft loop'? Soft loop is computer loop. Learning how to do looping is probably in every computer 101 course. Depending on which programming language you use, you may use keywords like 'while' or 'for' to do it. To give my definition, 'soft loop' is loop done by software, exactly like hard loop, it's nothing but looping human expertise, but this time, the expertise is coded in software rather than steel.

If you say, wait, Peter, are you talking about automation aided by software. You will be right. The concepts are nothing new to mainstream, but still I doubt mainstream people really know how much we can wrap in the soft loops.

## What is High Tech?
My personal definition is that high tech is soft loop plus AI.

High tech used to be nuclear power, robots, spaceshuttles, biotech and more, but Let's be honest for the past 40 years, human being has not made real breakthrough on the other areas expect software. If you talk about high tech in real world, it's amost nothing but software that I have in mind.

High tech is not so much about some surprising breakthroughs, it's about standardization. Tech moves forward like this, first we define a problem, then we form expertise sovling the problem, later the best practise will be widespread, and become knowledge free for everybody to use. Such knowledge is called industrial standards. But before computers, people didn't find standarlization very attractive. Because the world is a big place, people think and do things differently, a one fits all process to solve sth does not work so well. But when computer came, things were different. NO.1 All computers thinks only in 1/0, they are the same. NO.2 They repeat things tirelessly day and night. So it makes more sense to standardize everything, and get the same best practise run all over the world. Take Amazon for example, it is not doing something new, but it is a high tech company, because people always use software to repeat the best practises for everything. That also explains why high tech companies are always innovating fast, because what they do every day is looking to imporving the best ways to solve a problem then wrap them in computer loops. So In this sense what defines a high tech company is whether you consider software is the soul of your bussiness, rather than a component of your product. E.g Tesla is a high tech company. Toyota is not, even though Toyota cars also have code running.

AI is NOT soft loop. Soft Loop is computing repeating a same step by step receipe, AI is not this. No everything can be done in a step by step way, say teach a computer to do Go. AI(software 2.0) is to digging deep into big data, find the best path to achieve some goal. AI is as important as soft loop if not more. But since soft loop is much more easier to understand, I won't talk about AI here. IMO, as long as people really understand the power of soft loop, they should already be passionate enough to all-in high tech.

To me, high tech is mostly about doucumenting best practise with code, and repeat the code. 

## It's just the beginning
My goal here is to convince you high tech has not released even 1 percent of its power to change the world, yes, even in the year of 2020.

AI aside, Just the computer loops have not even reach it's one percent potential. There are still 99.99 of the daily tasks are not standarlized, not to mention looped by computers. In China, people are building lots of apartment buildings, but look, the process is still largely by human hands. People do want customization from time to time, but mostly people just want the best producted with best price. That's where standardization shines. With the economics of scale, standardlization can really brings us good products with low price.

Tech favors big. The bigger a company gets, the more willing it gets to get most out of computer loop. Big companies tend to invest more in researching the best practises for building something. In high tech world, I don't think competition should always be encouraged. More resource should just flow to the best player in a given area. For example, since nowadays Tesla is rich. It can do things that smaller companies can not. The idea that 'the machine to build machines' means you want to build your own robots. Tesla was able to buy a new robotic company, it was not something that a small company can afford. The world does not need a second and slightly inefficient Amazon, nobody will use the second best search engine. I believe it's logical to see only one company in more and more industies in the future. If we ever need a second company to coexists in one industry, that's is for other reasons, say, political balancing or backing up.

The use of computer loop will be extended to socitey managment too. Turned out, human wisdom is not just for building things, but also building a better society. The rise of Blockchain and Smart Contract demonstrates that many people wanting to run our society based on standards and clear rules. If you understand the power of soft loop. You won't consider blockchain a joke.

Everything has just got started, big tech companies has the potential to get much bigger, new wild ideas may come true. People don't understand high tech see bubbles, tech savvy people see the beer.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, I can get passionate about the possiblities of computer loop. So you will understand why people are so passionate about companies like Tesla, and Blockchain projects like Bitcion. I will encourage anybody to learn coding, invest in big tech giants or open standards, and help building more efficent industries, more fair society powered by human wisedom wrapped by computer loop.
